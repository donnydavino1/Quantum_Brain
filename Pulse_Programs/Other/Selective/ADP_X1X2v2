;the conventions is | 31P at 242.9506997 MHz (control bit), 31P 242.9516488MHz (target bit)>
;Phases are normally specified by 0 (X; 0°), 1 (Y; 90°), 2 (-X; 180°), 3 (-Y, 270°). In this case ph0=0, with no phase shifts.



;p1 is 90 on nuclei for channel F1 (P -450Hz), p2 is 90 on nuclei for channel F2 (P -1450Hz). p3 is 180 on nuclei for channel F1 (P -450Hz), p4 is 180 on nuclei for channel F2(P -1450Hz).
;with current power setting (W=0.0031623), and (spnam0=Gaus1.1000,1.59), p31_2=2769.000 usec for a 90 pulse
; H90 is 12.856, C180=21.364, H180=25.5  ;these are the values used as of 8/21/2023
;with the definitions above, there should be two types of pulse programs. _90xC_ and _90xH_. When initially setting up the programs p1 (p1 should always go with F1),p2,p3,p4,d4,PLW1,PLW2 were all preset. So these should not need to change.
;what to do with 90 degree phase diffre3nedc between C and H? Can PHC0 change this, or is more needed?
;make sure SR=0


"d9=30" ;d9 is the 5*T1=30
"d11=50m" ;d11: delay for disk I/O   [30 msec recommended] will do 50ms to give a little extra time
